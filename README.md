# RefugEAP Network

## Django

We can use **pip** to install Django. Input this command in our terminal:

pip install Django==4.0.2 

The latest official version is 4.1.5 but we are not using it because we are not sure if other packages are compatible with the latest version of django or not.

## RegugEAP directory

It is the base of our whole project. Inside the project, we should have different applications performing different tasks

Things below are the ***applications*** we have:

Pages: An application where we have our ***home page***, ***about us***, ***English page***, ***get involved***, ***contact us***.

ResueBank: An application where we have our resource reuse bank.

Login(?): An application where we have our login system

Blog(?): An application where we have our blogs and other information from different media

(?) means we are not sure if these apps are needed or not. <br>
If the Blog is designed and operated as a news website then an independent app for Blog is neccessary
