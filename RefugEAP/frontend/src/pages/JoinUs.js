          Network Working Group (e.g. working to help us build content for the
          website) or perhaps a volunteer tutor on the RefugEAP Programme, you
          can fill in this online expression of interest form

          Join the RefugEAP Network by subscribing to our JISCmail discussion
          list. This functions as a mutual support network for individuals and
          organisations involved and/or interested in developing widening
          participation initiatives for refugee-background students to
          facilitate access to HE via English language pathways, with a
          particular focus on English for Academic Purposes. It will also be a
          place where you can keep up to date with whatâ€™s happening in the
          Working Group and on the RefugEAP Programme (which will sometimes put
          out a call for more volunteer tutors via this JISCmail list)

          You could contribute to our RefugEAP Network Resource Bank Padlet. In
          particular, we are looking for people to share any relevant
          sanctuary-related job/role descriptions, so that we can begin to build
          a bank of these to share. Similarly, if you notice any category of
          resources missing, please let us know and we can then add it
        </p>

          Contribute a post to our website via the Blog. This might be in the

          Other similar networks which are not EAP-specific but which are very
          useful for those working in EAP/HE contexts are the Universities of
          Sanctuary JISCmail discussion list, and the Hub for European Refugee
          Education mailing list
