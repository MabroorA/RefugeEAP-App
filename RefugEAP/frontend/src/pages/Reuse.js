        EAP for Social Justice: Key Areas in Research and Practice
      </h4>
      <p>
      This is our EAP4SJ SIG ‘Master Padlet’, containing a range of resources exploring the intersection between English for Academic Purposes and Social Justice in all its messy complexity. Topic areas include, among many others: inclusive practices, Critical EAP, student and practitioner identity and precarity. We hope that this will provide a useful starting point for anyone interested in exploring this field. Please feel free to contribute/comment/share
