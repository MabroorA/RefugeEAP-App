      <h2>Our Aims</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <div id='paragraph'>
        <li>To put social justice on the agenda in EAP discussions concerning learning, teaching, scholarship of teaching and learning, research and operational matters, in part through widening the parameters of the field.</li>
        <li>To demonstrate the value of adopting a social justice lens in EAP, by broadening and strengthening the evidence base of the impact that this can make in our field.</li>
        <li>To work together with relevant organisations, movements and initiatives in recognition of the complexity and intersectionality of social justice work.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the creation of a welcoming and active EAP for SJ community of practice, through which participants can support each other, share good practice and be inspired to take action within their sphere of influence.</li>
        </div>
      </ul>
      <h2>Our Rationale</h2>
      <h3>A pragmatic view</h3>
      <ul>
        <div className='paragraphs2'>
        <li>Indeed, pragmatists may argue that the role of the EAP practitioner is, and should continue to be, limited to the nuts and bolts of teaching, learning, curriculum design and assessment, and that involvement in wider ideological concerns is beyond our remit. Such a perspective is often reinforced by the current trends towards the marketisation and commodification of programmes of study within the HE sector, which tends to instrumentalise activities related to these, thereby promoting in some learners and teachers a narrowing in how they see themselves and their roles. When seen in the light of Fromm’s humanist philosophy, such instrumentalisation can be regarded in terms of a general shift from being to having; from being a learner (or an educator) to having (or giving) a qualification in order to increase a student’s employability prospects through socialising them into existing cultural norms (Molesworth, Nixon & Scullion, 2009). An unequivocal alignment with this stance would imply that one believes that social justice has little to do with either EAP or with the remit of HEIs more generally.
</li>
        <li>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</li>
        <h3>An alternative view</h3>
        <li>However, there is a small but growing movement against this normative stance, stemming from the work of Freire (1970: foreword), who stated:
            There is no such thing as a neutral education process. Education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the   
            integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it, or it becomes the ‘practice of                                        
             freedom’, the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the
             transformation  of their world.
</li>
        <li>In terms of how Freirean philosophy has been applied to EAP, it is most overtly evident in the literature on Critical EAP and Academic Literacies, which both use a social justice lens to encourage teachers and learners to critique the underlying power structures of HEIs, specific disciplines, academia more widely and society as a whole in order to challenge inequality in its many forms. Though intuitively appealing to many EAP practitioners who regard themselves as educators in the humanistic tradition and who encourage learners to belearners, these two research streams have not made a significant impact on the mainstream theories and practices of EAP to date (Ding & Bruce, 2017), though Academic Literacies has made more of an impact in the field of Learning Development.
