          <h3>improve academic english</h3>
          <p>
            The RefugEAP Networkâ€™s overarching objective is to facilitate the
            development of widening participation initiatives enabling
            refugee-background students to access HE via English language
            pathways, with a particular focus on English for Academic Purposes
          </p>
          <p>
            It is for students who need to improve their academic English skills
            to help them access a degree programme at university, but perhaps
            have not been able to access a formal pre-sessional English for
            Academic Purposes (EAP) programme yet.
