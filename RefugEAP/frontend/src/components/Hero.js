        <p>
          The RefugEAP Programme is a parallel initiative to the RefugEAP
          Network. Whereas the Network is working to create more lasting
          opportunities for refugee-background students to access academic
          English courses across the HE sector through changing systems and
          processes, the Programme is functioning as a stop-gap which gives
          students a means to access academic English provision in the meantime.
