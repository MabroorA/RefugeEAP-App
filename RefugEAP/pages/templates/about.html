					<h2>Our Aims</h2>
				</div>
				<div class ="paragraph">
				<p>To put social justice on the agenda in EAP discussions concerning learning, teaching, scholarship of teaching and learning, research and operational matters, in part through widening the parameters of the field.</p><br>
 
				<p>To demonstrate the value of adopting a social justice lens in EAP, by broadening and strengthening the evidence base of the impact that this can make in our field.</p><br>
 
				<p>To work together with relevant organisations, movements and initiatives in recognition of the complexity and intersectionality of social justice work.</p><br>
 
				<p>To facilitate the creation of a welcoming and active EAP for SJ community of practice, through which participants can support each other, share good practice and be inspired to take action within their sphere of influence.</p><br>
				
				<h2>Our Rationale</h2><br>
				<h3>Why is the EAP for Social Justice SIG needed?</h3>
				<p>In the current era, it is difficult to ignore the fact that our universities, our countries and our world are riddled with inequality … but what has social justice got to do with EAP?</p></br>
				<h3>The pragmatic view</h3>
				<p>Indeed, pragmatists may argue that the role of the EAP practitioner is, and should continue to be, limited to the nuts and bolts of teaching, learning, curriculum design and assessment, and that involvement in wider ideological concerns is beyond our remit. Such a perspective is often reinforced by the current trends towards the marketisation and commodification of programmes of study within the HE sector, which tends to instrumentalise activities related to these, thereby promoting in some learners and teachers a narrowing in how they see themselves and their roles. When seen in the light of Fromm’s humanist philosophy, such instrumentalisation can be regarded in terms of a general shift from being to having; from being a learner (or an educator) to having (or giving) a qualification in order to increase a student’s employability prospects through socialising them into existing cultural norms (Molesworth, Nixon & Scullion, 2009). An unequivocal alignment with this stance would imply that one believes that social justice has little to do with either EAP or with the remit of HEIs more generally.</p><br>
				<h3>An alternative view</h3>
				<p>However, there is a small but growing movement against this normative stance, stemming from the work of Freire (1970: foreword), who stated:
				There is no such thing as a neutral education process. Education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the   
				integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it, or it becomes the ‘practice of                                        
				freedom’, the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the
				transformation  of their world.<br>


				In terms of how Freirean philosophy has been applied to EAP, it is most overtly evident in the literature on Critical EAP and Academic Literacies, which both use a social justice lens to encourage teachers and learners to critique the underlying power structures of HEIs, specific disciplines, academia more widely and society as a whole in order to challenge inequality in its many forms. Though intuitively appealing to many EAP practitioners who regard themselves as educators in the humanistic tradition and who encourage learners to belearners, these two research streams have not made a significant impact on the mainstream theories and practices of EAP to date (Ding & Bruce, 2017), though Academic Literacies has made more of an impact in the field of Learning Development.
				</p><br>
				<h3>SJ work that goes by other names</h3>
				<p>Notwithstanding, if one casts the net more widely into the field of EAP, it is evident that there are other emerging currents of discussion in our profession which have not necessarily overtly been associated with the term “social justice”, but which may, under close examination, be regarded as using a social justice lens. One such area of interest to many in the BALEAP community is that of the positioning of the EAP and the EAP practitioner within the neo-liberal university (e.g. Ding & Bruce, 2017; MacDonald, 2016; Hadley, 2015), and recent calls for practitioners to regard this as an opportunity to embrace “third space working” (MacDonald, 2016) and a re-definition their purpose and values (Ding & Bruce, 2017), which, for some, may involve adopting a social justice lens in their work. Indeed, one of the key aims of this SIG is to advocate for such a redefinition, and for social justice to lie at the heart of this.
				Another emerging theme evident from a close inspection of recent EAP literature and conference papers (e.g. Jenkins, 2019; Silburn, 2019; Brewer & Whiteside, 2019) is that of widening participation in HE through offering EAP pathways to groups such as forced migrants who traditionally face barriers. In their capacity as linguistic gatekeepers for entry onto academic courses, EAP units are ideally placed to take up the mantle suggested by Benesch (2001:130) of acting as “advocates for inclusion” rather than “enact[ing] exclusionary policies aimed at keeping out non-elite students”. EAP practitioners and managers at some HEIs have risen to this challenge, initiating and energising initiatives such as offering free places to forced migrants on pre-sessional programmes and working closely with local charities to provide pathway ESOL classes (see Palanac [2019] for an example of how this is working in practice at the University of Leicester). That EAP practitioners at a number of universities are thinking and acting in a similar vein was evidenced at the April 2019 BALEAP conference, in which there were three presentations focusing on EAP for forced migrants, detailing projects run by EAP practitioners in conjunction with charities such as the Council for At-Risk Academics (CARA), RefuAid and City of Sanctuary UK.
